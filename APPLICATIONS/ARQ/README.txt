This application is for simulating ARQ systems.
It features combined network and physical layer simulation in CAPSIM.

64 frames are generated. Due to errors in the channel, damaged frames 
are resent. So the total number of transmitted and received frames 
is greater than 64.


Try increasing the channel noise in the v29 hierarchical block.

Also you can try different frame sizes in bits. 
Do this through the  Arguments.
