Capsim Text Mode (C) 1989 XCAD Corporation
=============================



This program is based on an original concept called BLOSIM,
developed at the University of California, Berkeley, 1985.
The primary authors were D.G. Messerschmitt and D.J. Hait.
Since arrival at NCSU in November 1987 and through work done at 
XCAD Corporation, the program has been
extensively remodeled, debugged, and improved with many added features
including, but not limited to:
        - program re-organization, saving 20% on executable size.
        - improved scheduling for run-time efficiency
        - improved run-time logic to control buffer size
        - buffer memory de-allocation, for multiple runs
        - internal star and galaxy parameter model storage,
           specification, and definition.
        - on-line parameter prompting, with type/value checking
        - on-line review of commands and star/galaxy source files
        - command history and alias mechanisms
        - compilation control for UNIX or VMS operating systems

These changes and improvements are now considered copyrighted.
